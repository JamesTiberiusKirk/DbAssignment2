			ET world CEO and founder is Aylin Ibryamov. The name ET World was inspired by a popular nickname used by his peers - Alien. Struggling to earn a good living, he decided to open up a 2nd hand peripherals shop, selling to friends and family. Eventually, he developed a good set of contacts which brought his business to the next step. With a team of 5, ET World was ready for branding and manufacturing. Starting small with only peripherals to finally becoming one of the top companies in the market selling high quality OEM laptops and pre-built desktops for gamers around the UK, competing with huge brands such as alienware and msi.
